# Vacation rental market in Manhattan

## Overview
* I’ve been hired by a consulting company and my task is to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client is interested in investing in several properties but would like some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. My role in the project is to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights.

### Part 1 - Explore and filter the data
* There is a copy of the NYC Airbnb dataset.

1. Prepared tabs for documentation:
   - Added a tab for documenting the data cleaning steps and the different versions/updates of my Final Project file.
2. Organize the spreadsheet:
   - Freezed rows and columns to make scrolling through data easier.
   - Resized column widths and wrap text when was appropriate.
   - Added filters.
3. Filter listings:
   - Before I started filtering listings, I created a copy of the raw data to keep as a reference.
   - Documented all the rows I removed so that the client can understand the data cleaning steps I took.
   - Airbnb has some listings for longer-term rentals. Since this analysis is focused on vacation rentals, only rentals with a minimum night requirement of 7 days or fewer would be applicable.
   - Listings with no reviews from the last 12 months are most likely inactive.

### Part 2 - Which type of properties should be targeted?
* There are so many potential vacation rental properties in New York City that it can be overwhelming to determine where to start searching. My client would like help prioritizing where they should be focusing their research.

### Questions answered on the project:

* Which neighborhoods are most attractive for vacation rentals?
* Which size properties (i.e., how many bedrooms) are most popular for vacation rentals?

### Part 3 - Calculating occupancy
* The Airbnb data set has a calendar sheet with each listing’s availability for 30 days. Since there is a separate row for each combination of listing and date, I needed to aggregate the data in a pivot table to calculate the occupancy rate (% of nights that are occupied).
* What’s the average occupancy for each listing?
* Which days of the week have the highest occupancy rates?

### Part 4 - Estimate revenue for an investment property
* Estimating annual revenue requires a representative sample of properties that are similar to the type of property an investor might purchase (e.g., actively rented properties or properties with good reviews).
* I selected one of the top five neighborhoods and the corresponding property size that I’d like to recommend to my investor. To estimate annual revenue, I needed to calculate the average price and occupancy rates for a representative sample of listings.

### Part 5 - What attributes are important for a vacation rental?
* For the top neighborhoods, my investor would like some insight into what features and attributes might impact how well a property will perform.  

### Part 6 - Documentation and spreadsheet formatting
* Organized and documented my spreadsheet so it’s polished, professional, and ready to send to my client.
